## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ with cargo, rustfmt, clippy
- Godot 4.x engine
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL client tools

### Quick Start for Developers

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/OpenMMO.git
    cd OpenMMO
    ```

2. **Set up the development environment**
    ```bash
    # Start PostgreSQL database
    docker-compose up -d db

    # Install Rust dependencies
    cargo build

    # Set up database migrations
    cargo sqlx migrate run
    ```

3. **Run the server**
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin server
    ```

4. **Run the client**
    ```bash
    # Open in Godot Editor
    godot --path client/
    ```
